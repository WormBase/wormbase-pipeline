// i)   FIND A RELEVANT PLACE IN THE OBJECTS SECTION AND		 //
//      POPULATE THE NEW METHOD						 //

// iii) IF GFF3 DUMPING FOR THE OBJECT(s) ASSOCIATED WITH THE METHOD IS	 //

//      THE APPROPRIATE Ace2SO OBJECT				         //

Transcripts based solely on conservative analysis of the RNAseq data using methods similar to those described in Hillier et al., 2009. Briefly, the Illumina reads are aligned against the genome and an exhaustive coverage-based splice leader and splice junction database created using a permissive run of genefinder (Phil Green) allowing 0 scoring splice sites to be identified and then trimmed down to only include those sites with above threshold scores. Thresholds are set for an 0.05 false positive rate based on a ROC analysis. Transcripts are then created by seeding with splice junctions confirmed at 0.05 fdr and then continued as long as there is above threshold coverage. Splice leaders and polyA data are used to aid in determining starting and stopping points for transcripts. In the case of splice leaders, all splice leaders contained within a given prediction are used to create alternative versions of the transcript. In the case of polyAs, all transcripts stop when reaching a polyA (if additional polyAs are further downstream, still only a single shortest version of the transcript is created)."
